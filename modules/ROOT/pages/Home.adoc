= Tentative installer docs

Opencpn has a large set of plugins available. Most users need to have
one or more plugins to get a usable installation. The installer is an
effort to provide a simple way for end-users to install plugins. As
such, it also makes it easier to package Opencpn for different platforms
since the plugins doesn't need to be packaged.

The installer has a basic contract with plugins as described in
xref:Tarballs.adoc[Tarballs] and xref:Catalog.adoc[Catalog].

Here we have:
