The plugin developer interacts with opencpn via
. The plugins project at https://github.com/opencpn/plugins
. Tarballs which can be used by the installer
. XML metadata which provides means for opencpn to locate and download
the tarball.

The basic workflow for a new plugin is

. Clean-up and update the sources. See [Plugin
Adaptation](Plugin-adaptation)
. Modify the plugin sources so it produces a usable tarball
. Upload the tarball so it's available on an url.
. Create a new plugin catalog which contains metadata for the new
plugin.
. Make the new catalog the one used in opencpn.
. Test installing the new plugin using opencpn.
. Issue a pull request to https://github.com/opencpn/plugins with the
new catalog data
. The new catalog data becomes available to end users when the pull
request is merged.

After making these steps the new plugin is a available for end users.
For practical reasons, the best is to modify the plugin CI setup so it
produces uploaded tarballs and XML metadata as part of regular building.
