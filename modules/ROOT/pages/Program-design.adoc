= Design overview

== Supported platforms


The installer supports four platforms:

- Windows 
- Macos
- Debian
- Flatpak

The PR contains patches to make the mingw builds usable. However, the
core installer makes no difference between mingw or msvc builds.

The combination of Debian and Flatpak is aimed to cover the fragmented
Linux ecosystem. While Flatpak can be used on all Linux distros, having
Debian packages available makes sense for space-constrained embedded
systems like the Raspberry.

== Catalog and tarballs


These are the groundwork for the installer code. The catalog is the
complete list of available plugins presented to user. When user selects
a plugin, the catalog provides info so the plugin can be downloaded. See
[Catalog](Catalog) and [Tarballs](Tarballs)

== Installations


Plugins are installed in the user writable [installation
paths](Installation-paths).

After installation, a list of installed files is left in the [user
configuration directory](Terminology#_user_config_path), in the sub
directory `plugins/install_data`. This list is used when uninstalling.
If the list does not exist the installer assumes the plugin has been
installed using other means and will not change it in any way.

== Main modules affected

* pluginmanager.cpp has been patched to:

** Load plugins from the
   [User install dir](terminology#_user_install_path) on all platforms. 
   This make≈õ Macos and Windows work in a similar way as Linux.
** Support uninstallation of plugins in user install directories.
** Support a dynamic set of plugins. Prior to this PR, the set of
   plugins loaded at startup never changed.
* The two new modules download\_mgr and catalog\_mgr handles the download
  and catalog manager UI dialogs.
* The PluginHandler module is the backend side of plugins, mostly
  downloading and installing. Here is also code to handle the plugin 
  metadata.
* The PluginPaths module handles mapping of various paths to platform-
  specific values.
* OCPNPlatform has been patched to provide an extended set of platform
  paths, mostly to support loading plugins from user directories.

== Build chain

The `flatpak/` directory contains all necessary pieces to build a
flatpak version of opencpn. This has been incorporated to be able to
test flatpaked plugins.

The `ci/` directory contains changes to build mingw and also support for
deploying packages to cloudsmith.io. Build scripts has been refactored
to be usable also in other builders like circleci.com
