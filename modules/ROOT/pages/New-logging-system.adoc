Since 8e77124 (March, 11 2020) the logging system has been revised. Here
are three types of changes: new log file layout, new logging API and new
logging runtime options.

New log layout


The logfile now contains lines like

....
  21:18:21.858 MESSAGE chartdb.cpp:319 Chart cache PlugIn purge
....

Compared to the older format, the new format has

. Millisecond timestamps
. A type indicator which is either FATALERR, ERROR, WARNING,

....
  MESSAGE, STATUS, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE or PROGRESS
- The location where the message was created (file:linenumber)
....

New logging API

'''''

The existing API defined continues to work as before. In particular,
`wxLogMessage()` works as it always have, besides that the logged
messages look different (see above).

The new logging API is defined in the header `logger.h`. The basic
routines here is C-fashioned functions like `LOG_INFO("Things broke:
%s", why)` and C++ log sinks used like `INFO_LOG << "Things broke: " <<
why;` These exists:

....
  TRACE_LOG          LOG_TRACE()
  DEBUG_LOG          LOG_DEBUG()
  INFO_LOG           LOG_INFO()
  MESSAGE_LOG        LOG_MESSAGE()
  WARNING_LOG        LOG_WARNING()
  ERROR_LOG          LOG_ERROR()
....

These macros are extremely fast when not enabled (see below). There is
no need to guard for example LOG_DEBUG() with NDEBUG ifdefs. Leaving
them in the runtime makes it possible to enable them without
recompilation if required.

Runtime logging options

'''''

The new logging accepts a command line parameter `--loglevel <level>`
where _level_ is one of TRACE, DEBUG, INFO, WARNING or ERROR. The
parameter describes the lowest priority a message must have to be
logged. `--loglevel ERROR` only logs error messages, `--loglevel DEBUG`
logs all messages besides LOG_TRACE().

There is also an environment variable OPENCPN_LOGLEVEL which could be
set the same values as used by --loglevel

The default value is INFO i. e., everything besides debug() and trace()
messages is logged.

Usage and discussion

'''''

The lack of runtime configuration has forced us to have some discipline
when adding logging statements so the log doesn't become too big for
casual users. The new logging system makes it possible to

. Have a large number of LOG_DEBUG statements in the code, normally
disabled but

....
  possible to enable in runtime.
....

. Use under-used logging statements like LOG_WARNING to make serious
things to

....
  stand out.
....

. Replace ad-hoc logging like qDebug and plain printf() statements.

. Remove evil ifdefs guarding debug logging.
